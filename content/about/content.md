Waxosuit is a secure WebAssembly runtime environment for enterprise-grade, cloud-native applications with a focus on productivity and developer experience. This small host can run on your laptop/workstation, in _Docker compose_, in _Minikube_, _Kubernetes_, _Critical Stack_, or anywhere else a container scheduler can be used.

You can build serverless functions in WebAssembly or full microservices with Waxosuit. It allows you to delete the usual boilerplate required to create cloud-native applications so you can concentrate on writing just your business logic while leveraging Wasm's portability and Waxosuit's security, performance, and simple developer experience.
