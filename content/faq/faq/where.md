Waxosuit can run anywhere you can run a compiled binary. It is optimized for running in the cloud, but you can run it on your development workstation/laptop, in _Docker compose_, inside a single _Docker_ image, within _Minikube_, _[Critical Stack](https://criticalstack.com)_, _Kubernetes_, or any other container scheduler.

As long as the capability providers can satisfy their pre-requisites (e.g. connection to a message broker, database, etc), then Waxosuit will run just fine. Developer flexibility and ease-of-use are core to Waxosuit's mission.
