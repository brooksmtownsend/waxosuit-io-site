Waxosuit is a secure WebAssembly runtime environment for enterprise-grade, cloud-native applications with a focus on productivity and developer experience. It is a small application that loads a guest module (any [wascap](https://wascap.io)-compliant Wasm file) and securely binds it to a suite of cloud native capability providers that are dynamically loaded as plugins.
