**WebAssembly** is taking the web by storm, however we believe that WebAssembly will **truly** shine _in the cloud_. Most modern browsers today have everything you need to host a WebAssembly module (a _.wasm_ file) and communicate with it in JavaScript. In addition, there are already a number of extremely powerful tools (like _[wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen)_) that generate browser-friendly code to dramatically simplify that front-end web developer experience.

Waxosuit is designed around the following core tenets:

* Productivity - Developer **and** Operations
* Enterprise-grade Security
* Cost Savings
* Portability
* Performance

**[Wascap](https://wascap.io)** is a set of standards and conventions that attempts to fill the void for cloud-native Wasm module host environments. Using the **Waxosuit** host runtime, you can host WebAssembly modules as standalone processes on a laptop, as on-demand functions in a serverless environment, as always-available microservices, or even on Raspberry Pis and embedded devices.

**NOTE**: Wascap and Waxosuit are in their infancy. We encourage contributions and patience as we gradually fill out our documentation, tutorials, code samples, patterns, and more.
